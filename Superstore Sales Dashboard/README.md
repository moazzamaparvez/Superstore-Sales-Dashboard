# **Superstore Sales Data Analytics**

## **Overview**  
This project showcases my ability to analyze, clean, and visualize real-world sales data using **Microsoft Excel**. Using the popular **Superstore dataset**, I transformed raw CSV data into meaningful insights through data cleaning, PivotTables, charts, and an interactive dashboard.

The analysis highlights key trends in:  
- Regional sales performance  
- Category-level insights  
- Monthly profit patterns  
- Top customer contributions  

This project reflects a complete analytics workflow from raw data to final insights.



## **Tools Used**
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - PivotTables  
  - PivotCharts  
  - Slicers  
  - Dashboard design  
- **Power Query**  
  - Data loading  
  - TRIM & CLEAN transformations  
  - Duplicate removal  


## **Dataset**
- **Source:** Kaggle Superstore Dataset  
- **Original Format:** CSV  
- **Cleaned File:** `sales_data_clean.xlsx`  

The dataset contains information on orders, sales, customers, products, shipping, profit, regions, and more.



## **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

### **1. Cleaning Text Columns**
To remove inconsistencies and formatting issues, the following columns were cleaned:
- Customer Name  
- Product Name  
- Category  
- Customer ID  
- ZIP Code  

Techniques used:  
- **TRIM** to remove extra spaces  
- **CLEAN** for non-printable characters  
- **Find & Replace** for standardization  
- Power Query transformations  
- Duplicate row removal  



### **2️. Formatting Numeric Columns**
All numeric fields were standardized to ensure accurate calculations:
- **Sales** → formatted to **2 decimal places**  
- **Profit** → formatted to **2 decimal places** (negative values kept as real losses)  
- **Quantity** → formatted as **whole numbers**  
- **Discount** → formatted to **2 decimal places**  

This ensured consistency in PivotTables and charts.



### **3️. Formatting Date Columns**
Both date fields were cleaned and converted to proper date formats:
- Order Date  
- Ship Date  

### **4️. Final Validation Checks**
Before analysis, the dataset was reviewed for:
- Missing or invalid values  
- Uniform category naming  
- Correct ZIP code formatting  
- Accurate numeric calculations in PivotTables  

Result: a fully structured, analysis-ready dataset.
